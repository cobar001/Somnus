## Privacy Policy

Although Somnus records audio during your sleep, the data is only ever saved on device and is never collected elsewhere. However, if you are still uncomfortable with Somnus recording audio data and storing it locally, you may disable audio recording authorizations in your iOS Settings -> Somnus page. This will disable audio collection and still allow Somnus to put you to sleep and wake you normally.
